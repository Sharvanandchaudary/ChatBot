Financial Data Chatbot with CNN Integration
This project is a financial data chatbot that leverages Flask for backend functionality and processes data from Excel files using pandas. The chatbot can answer queries related to financial metrics and utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras for advanced data analysis and predictions. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.
